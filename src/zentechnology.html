        <h1>Bring the harmony of Whirlpool’s ZenTechnology into your home and laundry</h1>
        <p>As quiet as a whisper at 49dB during the wash phase and as little as 68dB during the spin cycle, Whirlpool’s ZenTechnology stops laundry from disturbing daily life.*</p>

        <p>The science of ZenTechnology’s supremely quiet cycles comes from a highly innovative and robust design, from the beltless motor connected directly to the drum, to the use of one single sheet of quality casing, noise is dispersed for less disruption.</p>
        <p>Combined with 6<sup>TH</sup> SENSE technology to assess and adjust the wash and spin phases of your load accordingly, Supreme Care is as tough on excessive noise as it is on stains.</p>

        <p>The Exposure Noise Pollution Index (ENPI) evaluates the perception of noise exposure in 11 countries all over the world. ENPI evaluates the amount, recurrence and length of the noises to which people are exposed to in big cities. The map represents the percentages of high noise exposure and highlights the noisiest city in each country involved in the survey.</p>
